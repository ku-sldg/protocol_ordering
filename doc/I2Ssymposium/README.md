# Abstract

## Title: Enhancing Remote Attestation Protocol Selection through Formally Verified Attack Graph Analysis

This research aims to enhance the evaluation of remote attestation protocols by introducing novel protocol ordering methodology. Leveraging existing tools, we aim to order Copland protocols in the context of an active adversary. Using system specificiation described in manifests and the Chase model finder, we generate all possible attacks as attack graphs to assess a protocol's vulnerability to potential security threats. Using Coq, we abstractly capture the attack graphs to compare protocols. Our key contribution lies in establishing a proven partial order over sets of attack graphs, providing a systematic approach to compare and analyze the security strengths and weaknesses of different remote attestation protocols. The proposed methodology enhances the understanding of protocol security, paving the way for more robust and resilient systems.
