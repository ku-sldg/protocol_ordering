# Abstract

This research aims to enhance the evaluation of remote attestation protocols by introducing a novel protocol ordering methodology. Leveraging Coq and the Chase model finder, we generated attack graphs to assess a protocol's vulnerability to potential security threats. Our key contribution lies in establishing a proven partial order over sets of attack graphs, providing a systematic approach to compare and analyze the security strengths and weaknesses of different remote attestation protocols. The proposed methodology enhances the understanding of protocol security, paving the way for more robust and resilient systems.
