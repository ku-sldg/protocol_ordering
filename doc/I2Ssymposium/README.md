# Abstract

During remote attestation, a relying party attests to the state of a target system by asking the target to perform one or more measurement operations. The relying party may then appraise the generated evidence to determine trust. In previous attestation works, measurement operations were provisioned by a knowledgeable user who considered situational demands to formulate a protocol. However, if attestation is to be widely adopted, there must be a more approachable, yet sound way to guide selection of an attestataion protocol. With this in mind, we introduce XXX: a formally verified means to select a situationally best attestation protocol. Our protocol ordering considers existing measurement operations found in manifests and thier susceptibility to attack. Using the model finder Chase, we enumerate protocol executations in the context of an attacker to generate criteria for ordering. We then use the formalized attack graphs to determine a protocol's susceptibility to attack. ......... Using Coq, we prove the properties of a preorder hold for our ordering.
