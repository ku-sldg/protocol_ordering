\begin{definition}[Homomorphism]
    A (graph) homomorphism $\eta : G \to H$ between graphs $G = (N_G, E_G, l_G)$ and $H = (N_H, E_H, l_H)$ is a function $\eta : N_G \to N_H$ on the nodes such that for every edge $(n_1, n_2) \in E_G$, $(\eta(n_1), \eta(n_2)) \in E_H$, and for every node $n \in N_G$, $l_G(n) = l_H(n)$.  \cite{Rowe:2021:OnOrdering}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Supports/Covers]
    Given two sets of graphs S and T, we say that S supports T iff for every $H \in T$, there is some $G \in S$, such that $G \leq H$. We  say that T covers S iff for every $G \in S$ there is some $H \in T$ such that $G \leq H. $\cite{Rowe:2021:OnOrdering}
